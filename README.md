HiomoBot is a Telegram bot that will send you messages containing the lunch menu of the day from the Hiomotie 32 Sodexo restaurant.

You can use commands to ask for the menu whenever you like, but you can also subscribe for daily messages and HiomoBot will send you a message everyday at 10:30 AM listing the available food for lunch.

Here are the commands that trigger a response from HiomoBot:

**/food** - Tells you the complete menu of the day.

**/fooden** - Tells you the menu of the day in English only.

**/foodfi** - Tells you the menu of the day in Finnish only.

**/foodtomorrow** - I'll tell you the complete menu of tomorrow.

**/open** - Tells you the opening hours of the restaurant.

**/subscribe** - Sends you a message everyday with the complete menu of the day at 10:30 AM.

**/unsubscribe** - Stops sending daily messages.

HiomoBot will also answer inline queries so you don't need to add him to your groups. Here are the inline queries that will trigger a response from him:

**@hiomo_bot food** - Tells you the complete menu of the day.

**@hiomo_bot fooden** - Tells you the menu of the day in English only.
